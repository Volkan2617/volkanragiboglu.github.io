This Read Me file provides an overview of my personal GitHub portfolio with three projects. Each project has its own index, javascript files, and style sheet.

## Including
1. A navigation bar with four tabs to walk through
2. Three projects with different levels of designs
3. Contact page to interact with
4. Three ways to contact with animation cards
5. Different styling and functions for each page

## Pages/Tabs
There are four tabs to navigate on the page and there is also one more that you can navigate from the landing/home page that you can also interact with.
1. Landing/Home page:
   This page has two interactions ->
   1. Contact Me goes to a different page where you can enter your own information to share your feedback or message.
   2. A video explanation of the page itself and a quick review of projects.
2. Bio/About page:
   This page has a picture of me and a quick review of the skills I used to develop this application.
3. Contact page:
   This page has three ways of contacting me.

4. Projects page:

## Projects:

### Pacman
This project has four different images of a Pacman changing its appearance as it moves through the page and when it hits  the edges, it changes its way to the opposite way, and so on

#### Files that are used for this project:
1. index.html
2. pacman.js

#### How to Run:
You can either fork or download the code to your local machine and start the index.html file as a live server.

### Eye Movement
This project has two eye images set in the middle of the page that follow the cursor of your mouse and as your mouse moves, eyes are going to follow your cursor through the page.

#### Files that are used for this project:
1. index.html
2. styles.css
3. eyes.js

#### How to Run:
You can either fork or download the code to your local machine and start the index.html file as a live server the same way as the Pacman project.

### Real-Time Bus Tracker
This project is a sample web application that displays the movement of a bus between MIT and Harvard on a map. It uses Mapbox GL JS for map rendering and animation. The bus moves between predefined stops along the route, and users can initiate the animation to track the bus's movement. If you want to try you can search through Google or Mapbox and add your own coordinates to track a different direction.

#### Files that are used for this project:
1. index.html
2. index2.html
3. mapanimation.js
4. mapdirections.js

#### How to Run:
You can either fork or download the code to your local machine and start the index.html file as a live server the same way as the other two projects but also there is a button called Get Directions. If you click that button and navigate to the second page that will have the option for you to write two new points to get directions as you want.


## Roadmap to Future Improvements
1. Going to add more pagination
2. Better and smoother animations
3. Some background pages and animations for each page
4. Search functionality on the navigation bar

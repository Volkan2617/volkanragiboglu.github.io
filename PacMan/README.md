# Pac-Man

This is a simple Pac-Man game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows Pac-Man to move left and right on the screen and changes its mouth position as it moves. Below are the instructions for running and understanding the project.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and folders:

index.html: The HTML file that displays the game board and Pac-Man.
pacman.js: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.
images/: A folder containing the images used for Pac-Man's animation.

## How to Run

To run the Pac-Man game, follow these steps:

Download the project files and ensure they are all in the same directory.
Open the index.html file in a web browser. This will display the game board with Pac-Man.

## Future Improvements

In future updates to this repository, we plan to work on the following improvements:

High Scores: Implement a high-score system to keep track of the player's performance.
Level Progression: Add multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
Sound Effects: Include sound effects for Pac-Man's movement and interactions.
Mobile Optimization: Make the game responsive for better playability on mobile devices.

## Gameplay

Click anywhere on the Pac-Man image to start the game.
Pac-Man will continuously move left and right across the screen, changing its mouth position as it moves.
Pac-Man will bounce off the edges of the screen when it reaches them.
To stop the game, simply refresh the web page or close the browser tab.

## Customization

If you want to customize the game or Pac-Man's behavior, you can modify the following:

Images: You can replace the Pac-Man images in the images/ folder with your own images, but ensure they have the same file names as the provided images (e.g., PacMan1.png, PacMan2.png, etc.).
Speed: You can change the animation speed by adjusting the setInterval duration in the pacman.js file. The current setting is 300 milliseconds.
Movement: You can change the movement behavior by modifying the logic in the Run() and checkPageBounds() functions in the pacman.js file.

## Credits
